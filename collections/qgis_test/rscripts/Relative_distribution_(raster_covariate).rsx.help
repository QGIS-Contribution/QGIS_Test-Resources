{"ALG_DESC": "This algorithm creates a graph that demonstrates the dependency of the intensity of the point process on the value of the given covariate. In this algorithm the covariate must be represented as a raster.

Enter the name of the covariate. It will appear at the graph.", "x_label": "Optional label for the X axis. Note that units at the X axis  will be the same as in the input layers.", "points": "The point process which distribution will be investigated.", "RPLOTS": "The empirical graph of the dependency of the intensity of the point process on the distance to the given objects.", "ALG_HELP_CREATOR": "Yury Ryabov\n2013\nriabovvv@gmail.com", "legend_position": "This field defines the position of the legend at the graph. 'float' means that the legend will be placed at the position that would not overlap the graph itself (or will try at least). Other options are: 'topleft', 'topright', 'bottomleft', 'bottomright'. ", "covariate": "The spatial covariate to the point process. The raster must not have discrete values, i.e. it may not be classified. Only rasters that represent continious phenomena (e.g. DEM, distance maps, etc.) are  allowed. Though classified rasters will be processed if supplied, but the results will be meaningless."}
