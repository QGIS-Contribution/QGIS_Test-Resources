{"ALG_DESC": "This is a Monte Carlo test for the point patterns. It is based on simulations from the null hypothesis. It generates randomly dinstributed points within the study region and uses K-function for each set of generated points and compares them to the K-function for the original set of points. Detailed description can be found in correspondin section of this book: http://www.csiro.au/resources/pf16h.\n\nThis script will provide both graphical ('R plots') and verbose ('R console output') output.\n\nR dependencies: library \"maptools\" and \"spatstat\"", "R_CONSOLE_OUTPUT": "Description of the test results.", "ALG_CREATOR": "Yury Ryabov\nriabovv at gmail dot com\n2013\nGPLv3", "Layer": "Point layer to be tested.", "RPLOTS": "Graph showing test results.", "ALG_HELP_CREATOR": "Yury Ryabov\nriabovv at gmail dot com\n2013\nCC-0", "Simulations": "Number of simulations for random points distributions.
