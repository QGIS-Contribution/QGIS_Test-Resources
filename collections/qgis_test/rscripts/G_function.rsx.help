{"ALG_DESC": "This R script computes simulation envelopes of the G(r) - nearest neighbour distance distribution function.\n\nThe nearest neighbour distance distribution function (also called the \u201cevent-to-event\u201d or \u201cinter-event\u201d distribution) of a point process X is the cumulative distribution function G of the distance from a typical random point of X to the nearest other point of X. An estimate of G derived from a spatial point pattern dataset can be used in exploratory data analysis and formal inference about the pattern. In exploratory analyses, the estimate of G is a useful statistic summarising one aspect of the \u201cclustering\u201d of points. For inferential purposes, the estimate of G is usually compared to the true value of G for a completely random (Poisson) point process, which is where lambda is the intensity (expected number of points per unit area). Deviations between the empirical and theoretical G curves may suggest spatial clustering or spatial regularity.\n\nR dependencies: library \"maptools\" and \"spatstat\"", "ALG_CREATOR": "Victor Olaya, volayaf(at)gmail.com", "Layer": "A point pattern process.", "Nsim": "Number of simulated point patterns to be generated when computing the envelopes.", "RPLOTS": "Plot with the simulation envelopes.", "ALG_HELP_CREATOR": "Filipe S.
