{"ALG_DESC": "This R script computes simulation envelopes of the F(r) - empty space function.\n\nThe empty space function (also called the \u201cspherical contact distribution\u201d or the \u201cpoint-to-nearest-event\u201d distribution) of a stationary point process X is the cumulative distribution function F of the distance from a fixed point in space to the nearest point of X. An estimate of F derived from a spatial point pattern dataset can be used in exploratory data analysis and formal inference about the pattern . In exploratory analyses, the estimate of F is a useful statistic summarising the sizes of gaps in the pattern. For inferential purposes, the estimate of F is usually compared to the true value of F for a completely random (Poisson) point process.\n\nR dependencies: library \"maptools\" and \"spatstat\"", "ALG_CREATOR": "Victor Olaya - volaya(at)gmail.com", "Layer": "A vector containg a point pattern.", "Nsim": "Number of simulated point patterns to be generated when computing the envelopes.\n\n", "RPLOTS": "Plot with the simulation envelopes.", "ALG_HELP_CREATOR": "Filipe S.
